# DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP AT OASIS INFOBYTE
## Task 1 : Iris Flower Classification
### Build a model to detect the classification of Iris Flower. Use a dataset containing information about  150 observations of iris flowers, with each observation consisting of four features and a target label. Used algorithm like Logistic Regresion, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict species based on these measurements.
## Task 3 : Car Price Prediction 
### Build a model to estimate vehicle prices based on features  features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. By training models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Lasso on historical data, the system predicts future prices, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
## Email Spam Detecction
### Build a model that can classify Email messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages in the mails.
